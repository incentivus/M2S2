Welcome to Blockchain-Simulator's documentation!
================================================
**Blockchain-Simulator** is a python package for simulate the interaction between miners and 
the impact of their behavior during the mining process.
In this simulator, a number of *policy* functions are set by default, which the agents act on.
In addition, the simulator can receive different policy functions from the input and evaluate its efficiency.
The simulation community can also be changed according to your needs.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the project.
